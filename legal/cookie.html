        <p>
          This Cookie Policy explains how IOFuze (" <strong>Company</strong>," "
          <strong>we</strong>," " <strong>us</strong>," and "
          <strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar technologies to
          recognize you when you visit our website at
          <a href="http://www.reputebee.com">http://www.reputebee.com</a> ("
          <strong>Website</strong>"). It explains what these technologies are
          and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or
          that becomes personal information if we combine it with other
          information.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, IOFuze) are called
          "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website
          owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable
          third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
          website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The
          parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer
          both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
          certain other websites.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></p>
        <p>
          We use first- and third- party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
          cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
          interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
          Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
          advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more
          detail below.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></p>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
          can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
          Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
          select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
          cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
          you with services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
          on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
          website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
          website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
          controls to accept or refuse cookies.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through
          our Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table
          below (please note that the specific&nbsp; cookies served may vary
          depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):

        <p>
          Cookies are not the only way&nbsp; to recognize or track visitors to a
          website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
          like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
          These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that
          enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened
          an email including them . This allows us, for example, to
          monitor&nbsp; the traffic patterns of users from one page within a
          website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
          understand whether you have come to the website from an online
          advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
          performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.
          In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
          function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
          functioning.

          <strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
          Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
          information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for
          other site operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can
          adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies

          Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
