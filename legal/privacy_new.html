<div>
<strong>
<u>
<em>If you are located in

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted
under applicable law to

If collection is clearly
in the interests of an

possible (for

We have
implemented
appropriate and
reasonable
technical and

measures
designed to
protect the

However, despite
our safeguards
and efforts to
secure your
information, no
electronic
transmission
over the
Internet or
information
storage
technology can
be guaranteed to

promise or
guarantee that
hackers, cybercriminals, or other
unauthorised
third parties
will not be able
to defeat our
security and
improperly
collect, access, steal, or modify
your
information.
Although we will
do our best to
protect your
personal
information, transmission of
personal
information to

Services is at
your own risk.
You should only

to
ask

match
it
with
information
you
have
previously

For
instance, depending

ask

to
provide

so
that
we
can

To
the
extent
possible, we

avoid
requesting

from
you
for
the
purposes
of
verification.
However, if
we
cannot
verify

may
request
that
you
provide
additional
information
for
the
purposes
of
verifying

and
for

purposes.
We
