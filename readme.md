## Description
This plugin is a powerful tool that lets you record all your Slack conversations and save them to a file for future use. You can capture the text messages that are sent or received in Slack. You can also configure the file name, location, format, and frequency of saving the messages. This plugin respects your privacy and security and does not share or upload your messages to any third-party service or server. You can also pause, resume, or stop the recording at any time. This plugin is useful for keeping track of your Slack communication, reviewing important information, documenting your work, and improving your productivity. This is a browser based plugin so it will adher to all the security and privacy policies of the browser extension.

## Requirements
The plugin should be compatible with the latest version of Chrome and Slack12.
In a Slack workspace which is already logged in, the plugin should be able to capture the API calls which happens in the backend to recieve the text messages that are sent or received in Slack.
    - The plugin should be able to access the Slack API and authenticate with the - user’s Slack account using the browser’s cookies or local storage.
    - The plugin should be able to intercept and parse the HTTP requests and responses that are made by the Slack web app to communicate with the Slack servers.
    - The plugin should be able to extract the relevant information from the API calls, such as the channel name, message text, sender name, receiver name, timestamp, and attachment type.
    - The plugin should be able to store the extracted information in a local variable or buffer until it is ready to save it to a file.

The plugin should be able to monitor all the channels and direct messages that the user is a member of or has access to.

I would like to develop a browser extension which is capable of the below. Can you design a system which is capable of the following : 
    - The plugin should be able to access the Slack API and authenticate with the - user’s Slack account using the browser’s cookies or local storage. 
    - The plugin should be able to intercept and parse the HTTP requests and responses that are made by the Slack web app to communicate with the Slack servers. 
    - The plugin should be able to extract the relevant information from the API calls, such as the channel name, message text, sender name, receiver name, timestamp, and attachment type.
    - The plugin should be able to store the extracted information in a local variable or buffer until it is ready to save it to a file. 

It would be good if you can come up with a psedocode for performing these operations in a browser extension. Please consider the browser to the chrome with any latest version.

 You can use JavaScript, a programming language that runs in the browser and can manipulate the HTML elements on the page. JavaScript has a method called drawImage(), which lets you draw an image onto a canvas element2. A canvas element is a blank area where you can draw graphics using JavaScript. For example, you can create two images and load them into JavaScript variables, then create a canvas element and get its context (the object that provides drawing methods). Then you can use the drawImage() method to draw the first image onto the canvas, and then draw the second image with some transparency (using globalAlpha property) on top of it2. You can also add some event listeners to detect when the user scrolls the page, and change the position or opacity of the images accordingly2.
